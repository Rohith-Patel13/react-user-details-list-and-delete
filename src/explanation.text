When the app loads:

The App component initializes its state with searchInput and userDetailsList based on the provided data.
The render method is called to initially display the list of user profiles.
Typing in the search input:

As you type in the search input field, the onChangeSearchInput function is triggered.
The searchInput state is updated with the new value.
The render method is called again, causing the UI to update with the filtered search results.
Clicking the delete button in a user profile:

Each UserProfile component is rendered based on the filtered search results.
Each UserProfile component receives the deleteUser function as a prop from the App component.
When you click the delete button in a user profile, the onDelete function in the corresponding UserProfile component is triggered.
The onDelete function is executed:

Inside the UserProfile component, the onDelete function is executed when the delete button is clicked.
The onDelete function calls the deleteUser function passed down from the App component, passing the uniqueNo of the user profile as an argument.
The deleteUser function is called:

The deleteUser function in the App component is called with the uniqueNo of the user to be deleted.
Inside the deleteUser function:
It retrieves the current userDetailsList from the state.
It filters out the user with the given uniqueNo, creating a new array without the deleted user.
It updates the state with the new filtered userDetailsList.
As the state is updated, the render method of the App component is called again.
UI re-renders:

The render method of the App component is called after the state update.
The UI updates to reflect the new userDetailsList, which no longer includes the deleted user.
The list of user profiles displayed on the screen will no longer show the deleted user's profile.
In summary, clicking the delete button triggers a sequence of events that involve the UserProfile component, the deleteUser function in the App component, and state updates. The UI is re-rendered to display the updated list of user profiles after the deletion.
